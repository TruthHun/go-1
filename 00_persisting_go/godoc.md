To display all function declarations in browser: run this command:

`godoc -http=":8080"`

Anything you put, save, or download into **GOPATH/src** folder will show up on http://localhost:8080/pkg/

You can replace the port number "8080" with different port number.


To display the results in CLI:

`godoc <yourFolder>`

Replace `<yourFolder>` with your folder in **GOPATH/src**.
